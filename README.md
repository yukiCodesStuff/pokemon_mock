# Welcome to PokeMock! (Work in Progress)
This is a small project attempting to mock basic elements from the well know game Pokemon! In this mock, I am using the SFML2 framework, which is able to handle a wide array of game based elements and mechanics, ranging from handling sprites and animations to basic game functionality such as movement and playability.

## Key Takeaways
Through this project, I learned alot about Object Oriented Programming, and how to best structure my code when it comes to game development. I also learned a lot about practical use cases for C++, having a more traditional background in the language as it is my language of choice for competitive programming. It was interesting to see how in some situtations, pointers hold great benefit, and being weary of dynamic allocations and imports became quite the headache at times.

Thanks for taking the time to check out this project!
